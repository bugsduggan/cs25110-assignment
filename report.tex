\section{Introduction}
% 2000 Students, 50 Academic Staff, 50 Graduate/research, 10 Admin

\section{Server Room}
\subsection{Physical Requirements}
The room designated to be the server room will require enough space to house all
of the equipment with enough space available above it for adequate ventilation
and access to any cables which may be run along the ceiling.

There will be 3 42U server racks in the centre of the room allowing full access
to both the front and the back of the cabinet. It is imperative that these be
grounded correctly so that any electrical anomalies do not present a threat to
human health. These will provide adequate space for all the equipment specified
in this document in addition to space for future requirements.

\subsection{Service Provision Requirements}
Power will be provided to the server room by way of a big grey box on the wall.
% TODO
This will be distributed to the hardware by way of rack-attachable power strips
with monitoring capabilities (such as those provided by Geist).

This power will be backed-up by an Uninterruptable Power Supply. % TODO

The server room will be connected to the internet (and the other campus) by
means of Fibre Optic connections such as those offered by Creative Telecoms.

\subsection{Other needs}
Server cooling will be provided by 3 Airedale OnRak units. These will dissipate
the heat generated and will fit into the back of each of the server racks.

The server room must be fitted with a fire suppression system. This should use a
gasseous suppression agent such as CO\textsubscript{2} which will not damage the
sensitive equipment. This \emph{will}, however require more space to be made
available to store the suppression agent.

Physical access to the room must also be kept to only those staff members who
require access to complete their tasks (and every effort should be made to
enable them to work without access to the server room). Access will also be
monitored through the key card access system (see \ref{sec:security}).

\section{Project Management}
\label{sec:projman}
The project will be overseen by a steering group chaired by a representative of
the University (henceforth known as the Project Client). This steering group
will contain a representative from all major departments of the University, a
Project Manager and the head of ICT Services.

The group will be responsible for the specification of the services to be
provided along with the smooth running and continuous management of the project
(as overseen by the Project Manager).

\subsection{Risk Analysis}
During the planning and development phase of the project, the following risks
have been identified.

\subsubsection{Incorrect provision of hardware}
It is possible that the hardware outlined in this and future documents is
incompatible or unfit for purpose. If this is the case, new devices will be
specified and decided upon by the steering group.

\subsubsection{Overrunning of Budget}
While every effort has been and will continue to be made to ensure that all
financial forecasts are accurate, unforseen expenses my be incurred. As such, it
is recommended that a contingency of 10\% of the overall project cost be
included during planning which may be used to mitigate the risks of financial
over-spend.

\subsubsection{Late Delivery of Project Goals}
Each phase of the project should have an established goal and time frame within
which to be achieved. This should be closely monitored and regulated by the
steering group and \emph{any} concerns should be raised as soon as possible so
that mitigating action may be decided upon and undertaken by all relevant
parties.

\subsubsection{Failure to Deliver by External Contractors}
Any phases of the project requiring external contractors are subject to further
risks as a result of the work being undertaken (e.g. work not being finished on
time or to correct specification). Therefore, any such phase should be given
extra attention by the steering group and any specifically identifiable risks
should be pre-emptively mitigated as far as is possible.

\subsubsection{Incorrect/Late Delivery of Hardware}
It is possible that hardware be delivered late or even damaged. Records of
\emph{all} purchases and deliveries must be kept so that any
disputes/discontinuity may be dealt with as swiftly as possible.

\section{Hardware}

\subsection{Server Hardware}

There will be 2 HP ProLiant DL320 G6 application servers. One of them is to be
kept as a back-up/testing server.

There will also be 6 Dell PowerEdge R320 rack servers which will provide the
firewall, E-mail, print and web services. One of these will be the test web
server and one will be a back-up/spare.

\subsection{Network Hardware}

The server room itself will require 2 ethernet switches such as those
provided by Cisco, one to provide connectivity to the servers (and any
peripheral Ethernet devices) and one to connect to the rest of the campus.

Further switches will be required to access areas further away from the server
room. The location and quantity of these is to be specified by the steering
group.

\subsection{Storage Hardware}
% TODO

% Second site?

\section{Software}
\subsection{IT \& Services Software}
All of the servers (with the exception of the firewall and network storage covered below) will be installed with the most current version of Debian. I
believe this to be one of the most well-established and supported server OS
available (and it's free).

\subsubsection{Application Servers}
The application server will be used to provide software as a service to the
users. The following list is expected to grow as a result of further
requirements gathering activities outlined in section \ref{sec:projman}

Intacct Financial and Management Accounting software will be installed to
provide payroll, PoS, budgeting and accounting services to administrative staff
and public cafe/bar areas.

A Learning Management System will be provided by Blackboard. Blackboard has a
large market share and industry backing \cite{bb} and although open-source
alternatives were considered, none provide the range of features and support
available from Blackboard.

\subsubsection{Firewall}
One of the servers will operate as a dedicated firewall and gateway. It will be
installed with Smoothwall, a dedicated firewall distribution of Linux. It is
open-source and fairly well supported through its online documentation and
manuals.

\subsubsection{E-mail}
One of the servers will function as a dedicated e-mail server. It will be
installed with Exim as the Mail Transfer Agent and RoundCube as the webmail
front-end. Exim has been growing in popularity over recent years and is well
supported on Debian platforms\cite{exim}.

\subsubsection{Printing}
Print services will be provided using the CUPS set of standard print spooling
tools on another, lower powered, Debian machine.

\subsubsection{Network Storage}
The network storage specified comes with its own specialised OS and software.
There is a client application available to access the storage but since the
device uses standard network file storage protocols, this should not be
necessary (and is not available for Debian systems at the time of writing).

\subsubsection{Webserver}
One server will be given over to providing both the external website and an
internal intranet. Nginx will be installed as the webserver. Nginx has been
growing in popularity since its inception \cite{nginx}. It is open-source and considerable
less memory-intensive than Apache.

\subsection{User Software}
All student and staff workstations will be installed with Windows 7. I Believe
this to be a well understood platform for the average user and it may be
possible to purchase a support contract from Microsoft.

Research students may require other versions of Windows or even Linux to be
installed in order to run legacy applications critical to their work. In this
case all software should pass through the audit procedures outlined below (see
\ref{sec:security}) before it is installed.

General office tools (word processor, spreadsheets, presentations etc.) will be
provided by LibreOffice. This is not too dissimilar from commercial offerings
and does not require licenses to be purchased.
