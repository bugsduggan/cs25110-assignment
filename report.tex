\section{Introduction}
% 2000 Students, 50 Academic Staff, 50 Graduate/research, 10 Admin

\section{Server Room}
\subsection{Physical Requirements}
% Ceiling/floor height

There will be 3 42U server racks in the centre of the room allowing full access
to both the front and the back of the cabinet. It is imperative that these be
grounded correctly so that any electrical anomalies do not present a threat to
human health. These will provide adequate space for all the equipment specified
in this document in addition to space for future requirements.

\subsection{Service Provision Requirements}
% Power UPS
% Network

\subsection{Other needs}
Server cooling will be provided by 3 Airedale OnRak units. These will dissipate
the heat generated and will fit into the back of each of the server racks.

The server room must be fitted with a fire suppression system. This should use a
gasseous suppression agent such as CO\textsubscript{2} which will not damage the
sensitive equipment. This \emph{will}, however require more space to be made
available to store the suppression agent.

Physical access to the room must also be kept to only those staff members who
require access to complete their tasks (and every effort should be made to
enable them to work without access to the server room). Access will also be
monitored through the key card access system (see \ref{sec:security}).

\section{Project Management}

\section{Hardware}
% Application Server(s)
% NAS
% Firewall
% Network switches
% Print/mail server
% Second site switch

\section{Software}
\subsection{IT \& Services Software}
All of the servers will be installed with the most current version of Debian. I
believe this to be one of the most well-established and supported server OS
available (and it's free).

% Firewall
% E-Mail

\subsection{User Software}
All student and staff workstations will be installed with Windows 7. I Believe
this to be a well understood platform for the average user and it may be
possible to purchase a support contract from Microsoft.

Research students may require other versions of Windows or even Linux to be
installed in order to run legacy applications critical to their work. In this
case all software should pass through the audit procedures outlined below (see
\ref{sec:security}) before it is installed.

% Office package (LibreOffice)

\section{Security}
